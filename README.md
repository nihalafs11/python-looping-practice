# Python Loops Warmup Assignment

This assignment contains three exercises to practice different types of loops in Python.

## Exercises

### 1. Guessing Game (`guessing_game.py`)
- Use a while loop to create a number guessing game
- Target number is 15
- Provide hints (too high/too low)
- See `README_GuessingGame.md` for details

### 2. Multiplication Table (`multiplication_table.py`)
- Use nested for loops to print a multiplication table
- Print table from 1 to n
- See `README_MultiplicationTable.md` for details

### 3. Reverse String (`reverse_string.py`)
- Use loops to reverse a string (no slicing allowed)
- Build the reversed string character by character
- See `README_ReverseString.md` for details

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run tests:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/ -v
   ```
